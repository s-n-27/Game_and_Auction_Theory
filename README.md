# Game_and_Auction_Theory
The main idea of the project is to study about the impact of game theory on different auction types. 
We have constructed two games each with a different auction type and analyzing the key results obtained.
We have tried to run the games as soon as possible.
The game rules and their respective codes are uploaded. Along with it we have also uploaded the outputs we obtained during our experiment.
